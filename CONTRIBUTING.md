Hello there,  
Thanks for trying to contribute to this Repository.  
You can contibute to this Repo if it is in-accordance with __The Kerala Technological Universitiy__'s CS/IT syllabus.  
This is basically for the Aspiring First Year Students and the programs can be either in __Python__ or __C__.  
Algorithms can also be Updated but must be shared according to the Question.
